SOTA distance calculator
SO9ARC (C) 2018
--------------------------

1.php - automatically sends POST form to QTH locator calculator web site
	You need only to fill parameters like below:
	http://your-web-server.com/SOTA/1.php?mygrid=JO70wa&fagrid=JO90xa
1.html - do the same as 1.php but not automaticly. You need to press Submit button.

Both files use JavaScript, so they work only in JS enabled browsers.

get-distanse-beetween-locators.bash - do the same as above, but using curl.
	So it works fine without any web browser. Just Linux shell :)

get-callsign-info-page.bash - Gets callsign info (especially QTH Locator) from qrz.com database (Limited to 100 request/24h if you are not a premium member)
Usage: ./get-callsign-info-page.bash <callsign>
Example: ./get-callsign-info-page.bash SO9ARC

get-multiplecallsigns-info-page.bash - Gets callsign info (especially QTH Locator) from qrz.com database. Use get-callsign-info-page.bash script to get multiple callsigns info. Prepare list of callsigns in text file SP-chasers_calls.txt, one by line. You can also use other file with option -f <filename>
No output is generated when working. 

create-pair-callsign-locator-from-full-qrz-com-info-page.bash 
	Prints to stdout pair callsign-locator, one pair in line
	for each callsign in database (obtained via get-callsign-info-page.bash, get-multiplecallsigns-info-page.bash or similar script)
If no locator found on qrz.com for callsign, locator in output is set to ??????


How to use this machine? There are so many scripts!

You have two options. Generate everything from scratch, if this is your first use of the scripts on this computer, or pass over some steps, if you have some work done.

1. Generate everything from scratch:
Go to http://sotadata.org.uk/summits.aspx, select desired Association and Region.
