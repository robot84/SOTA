1.php - automaticly send POST form to QTH locator calculator
	you need only fill parameters like below:
	http://kamery-tatry.ovh/SOTA/1.php?mygrid=JO70wa&fagrid=JO90xa
1.html - do the same as 1.php but not automaticly. You need to press Submit button.

Both files use JavaScript, so they work only in JS enabled browsers.

get-distanse-beetween-locators.bash - do the same as above, but using curl.
	So it works fine without any web browser. Just Linux shell :)
