These scripts search for non-existing summit reference numbers, that existed in the past and print them to stdout.
It can be useful, when you build your summit database, and want to know, for which summit references you must obtain locator manually.

Input file must have the format:

SP/BZ-001
SP/TA-013
OK/PO-081
...


When you find locator for one of these summits, you can merge it to summits_database:
Warning! Be careful and use ">>" operator insted of ">" which overwrite database, not append to it.

cp ../../resources/summits_database.dat ../../resources/summits_database.dat.bak

cat >> ../../resources/summits_database.dat
