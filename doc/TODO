Write in README how to run all tests

Save partial results of calculating distance for QSOs.
You would not like to compute everything from the beggining when your internet connection goes down.

Handle situations when no information about chaser in our db and we can't calculate distance for this particular QSO


Fixes:
src/get-summits-locators.bash:
	if data for the same summit is collected more than once, and is updated, so old locator is different than new, old locator is still used instead of actual one! (grep is matching first matching line. line with lower number is the old one.
	case when summits-locator.dat file doesn't exist and we have no permission to create it is not handled 
- perform checking if on system curl and html2text is installed (maybe other dependiences?)
Feature: caching locator pair distance
	don't query more than one time, when the same pair of locators queried for distance calculation
